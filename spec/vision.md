# Vision

This application implements the Studio Model, where idea creation, validation, and scaling are democratic and accessible to anyone across the team. To enable this, developers need the ability to register ideas, access information about the business domain and product context, and validate concepts with customers and peers. 


# Capabilites

* Idea Backlog – a list of ideas, consisting of a name and hypothesis, and validation status. Validation Status can be (First Level, Second Level and Scaling).
* Linked an Idea is tasks, these are the things we have to do to implement the idea. 
* Team we have to define the cross functional team members, they have first name, last name and role
* tasks have an owner which can be multiple team members 
* There should be a form to enter an idea, this should allow me to integrate with an agent to help me generate and refine the idea
